# OpenAuto RtAudio fix
Forked from the official repo with only one change done as per:
https://github.com/openDsh/dash/issues/179
I just needed to upload it to make it public so I can replace the "openautoRepo" reference in install.sh with mine here.

### Description
OpenAuto is an AndroidAuto(tm) headunit emulator based on aasdk library and Qt libraries. Main goal is to run this application on the RaspberryPI 3 board computer smoothly.

### Build Guide
#### Local build instructions for Raspberry Pi

Having <a href="https://github.com/openDsh/aasdk">aasdk</a> built and install first is a prequisite for this task. Please complete the necessary aasdk steps before proceeding here.

```sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get -y install cmake build-essential git

sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev libusb-1.0.0-dev libssl-dev cmake libprotobuf-dev protobuf-c-compiler protobuf-compiler libqt5multimedia5 libqt5multimedia5-plugins libqt5multimediawidgets5 qtmultimedia5-dev libqt5bluetooth5 libqt5bluetooth5-bin qtconnectivity5-dev pulseaudio librtaudio-dev

git clone https://github.com/OpenDsh/openauto

mkdir openauto_build; cd openauto_build

cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DRPI3_BUILD=TRUE -DAASDK_INCLUDE_DIRS="../aasdk/include" -DAASDK_LIBRARIES="../aasdk/lib/libaasdk.so" -DAASDK_PROTO_INCLUDE_DIRS="../aasdk" -DAASDK_PROTO_LIBRARIES="../aasdk/lib/libaasdk_proto.so" ../openauto

make -j2
sudo make install
```

The executable binary can then be found at ~/openauto/bin/autoapp
